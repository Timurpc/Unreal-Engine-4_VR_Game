## Project name:
**Singijeon VR** (Educational game about Korean weapon Hwacha)
---
### Project goal:
Developing Hwacha informative Game using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) for VR game model. And teach people how to use Hwacha and spread Korean historical weapon all around the world.

### Main tasks of the project:
Landscape - Materials and Foliage tool / Terrain  
Creating levels with Steam Load Level system.
Connecting and using Oculus Rift-S with VR project.
Writing a blueprint script for each function.
Shooting with Hwacha and targeting the enemy.
Touching objects and moving with teleport using VR controllers.
Decorating the levels and putting ready 3D models to the exact levels.
Head-tracking system instead of teleportation to move.
LeapMotion for touching objects and get rid of VR controllers.
Score and time counter for the game mode level.
Working with high-quality effects and particles.

### Definition for main task list:
Why Landscape is important? -- The landscape is used for big levels and it gives a chance to use foliage tools. Using a Landscape Terrain Actor quickly provides you with a very large area to spawn your forest(nature levels) on. 
The Level Streaming feature makes it possible to load and unload map files into memory as well as toggle their visibility during play. This makes it possible to have worlds broken up into smaller chunks so that only the relevant parts of the world are taking up resources and being rendered at any point. If done properly, this allows for the creation of very large, seamless games that can make the player feel as if they are playing within a world that dwarfs them in size.
Installing Oculus Rift-S to the computer, checking and learning how to use the HMD and Controllers properly. Installing the VR plugins to the Unreal Engine 4.22 with supportable versions. Fixing Controller input keys,  writing blueprint scripts: teleportation, rotation, and grab/drop functions. Camere position and HMD height.
 Writing a blueprint script for each function: touchable objects, load level system box, day and night system in the training level, Singijeon Fireball Projectile (when get fired, shot and target the enemy directly), target(boat) get damage and explosion, play narration step when the user touches the Singijeon, and some small details…
Shooting with Hwacha: Fireball Projectile (when get fired, shot and target the enemy directly). Creating a blueprint script for mathematical equation of trajectory. Trajectory is importing to show flying Singijeon so realistically. 
The step explained in the 3rd section (Oculus).
Making small levels and locating the objects to the exact location. As an example: Walls, trees, Singijeons, grass, boats, Hwacha, torch, stones for making the way, desert and other detailed objects.
What is Head-tracking system? It is used for moving and going to the far destination with only head-shaking instead of using the controller teleportation or walking. Why I used this because we wanted to use the LeapMotion (to get rid of controllers). In this case, we need to move to the destinations to finish our game as a player.
LeapMotion for touching objects. Latest hand tracking brings the user’s AR/VR experience to the next level. Technology is embedded directly into the next generation of VR/AR headsets. User will have a chance to use his/her hands and fingers and can see them in the game (VR). They can touch things and grab/drop using their hands with the help of LM.
Score and time counter. For the purpose of making the game more interesting, I wanted to use these functions. User should finish the steps (firing the rope of the hwacha to shoot the enemy with firing torch) in two minutes. And they can get a score if they can do it on time. Otherwise, they will lose the game (game over).
Effects and particles. I tried to use VFX (Visual Effects) to show fire and fireball projectiles with high quality (ocean water flow). I used lots of particles in this project (for fire, torch, lamp, dust, even for tree leaves). Furthermore, in this project the user can feel the real world with the help of sound effects (fire, shooting, explosion and good choice of background music). 

### This game can be played by(platform and devices):
Oculus Go, Oculus Rifts-S, LeapMotion, Gear VR, Samsung Odyssey, Android mobile phones with at least Android 7 or higher, and also IOS users can play because in the input section all inputs and packaging settings are have been fixed for these platforms.

### Participated in "2019 International Conference"
We participated in "2019 International Conference" (for A.I. Challange to future finance) with this project (Hwacha).
Location: Ehwa University, Seoul, South Korea.
